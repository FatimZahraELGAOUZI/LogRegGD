<h1>Projet R : LogRegGD package R </h1>
This project is part of our programming course R.The main objective is to develop an R package offering: Binary logistic regression with stochastic gradient descent method with the ability to exploit the capabilities of cores processors.
The LogRegGD is a package which allow you to do a logistic regression using the stochastic gradient descent with 3 modes :
-Batch mode with the possibility of using parallel programming
-Mini-batch mode
-Online mode
